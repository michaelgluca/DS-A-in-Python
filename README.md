# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

**Introduction**

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to efficient problem-solving and software development. Understanding these concepts is crucial for any aspiring software engineer or computer scientist. This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms, along with detailed explanations and examples.

**Contents**

Basic Data Structures: Includes implementations and explanations of stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.\
Sorting Algorithms: Features classic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.\
Search Algorithms: Covers algorithms such as Linear Search, Binary Search, and more advanced techniques.\
Graph Algorithms: Includes algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall.\
Dynamic Programming: Contains examples of dynamic programming approaches for solving complex problems.\
Miscellaneous: Other important algorithms and data structures topics.\
Each section includes source code, a README file explaining the concept, and examples to help understand how to implement and use the data structures and algorithms.
